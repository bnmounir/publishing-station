Entry level developer positions are extremely competitive, preparing strategy is extremely important to achieving one's goal.

### "Everything is purple"

> Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to some false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias... [\[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)

The stories that we hear everyday tend to be about success stories. This is because we are very receptive to them whereas failure stories are usually untold. That can be quite counter intuitive, failure stories teach us and guides us as much as success does which leads to biases and distortion of what to expect.

### Tutorial Hell and Cognitive dissonance

> Cognitive dissonance is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein they try to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort... [\[source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)

Not too long ago, a friend of mine was having so much doubt about his ability to unlock an entry level position, I was exposed to the same thoughts. the problem was following unconventional paths (bootcamp or being self-taught) there was an unbearable stream of information on how to do it, mostly noise. Unfortunately between self promoters and marketers valuable information was lost in the haystack.

It takes time and strategy to build the skills and unlocking that first job, more time than what a bootcamp or an online course will promise. And careful strategy when it comes to where and who's information to seek. There are so many great instructors online but there's many more that will sway you in the wrong direction losing valuable resources and falling in tutorial hell.

# Solutions

Strategic Notes:

1. Build good habits, they give you momentum.
2. Use the pomodoro technique for sustainability.
3. Be suspicious of "become software engineer 12 weeks" scheme.
4. Put in the hours, tip the scale. It will take years to unlock their first job.
5. Get the metrics: hours, projects build and everything in between.
6. Write and take screen shots about every project you finish that how you defeat imposter syndrome and remind yourself of your progress. [exemple](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app/blob/master/README.md)
7. Last, here's a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-UvSKe8jW4) that summarizes some great concepts.



Everyday todo list:

1. code challenge 45min
2. meditation and exercise 45min
3. reading for fun 25min
4. sleep >= 7hrs
